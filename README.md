# Mohaned ElDeeb's College Projects

Hello, I'm Mohaned ElDeeb. This repository contains a collection of my college projects. These projects are primarily focused on various aspects of computer science and software development.

## Projects

The projects in this repository are not complete in the literal sense. Some of them might be an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) without the backend, etc. They are intended to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout my college journey.

### SQL Project for Speedrun Web-Application: 

The term's final project for the Introduction to Databases course required us to create a team-based project of our own choice. My and my team settled on creating a DB for a SpeedRun web application. Since this was an individual project, we didn't have the web application itself, however the database design was ready.

### Java-Lab Pharmacy Project

For the Java-Lab, there was a relatively big project for a normal assignment that required from us to create a project that represents the functionality of a real-life Pharmacy.

### Java-Lab Term's Project for a Hypermarket Account Manager

The third term's final project required from us to create an Account Manager for a Hypermarket type of business. In the Project's folder there exists a UML diagram, and a Design Document.
